My BFS algorithim, will make a queue, and will have a boolean signal to check when we get to a state that is equal the goal.
The algroithm will put nodes onto the queue in the order of moves left, up, right, down, until we find the solutuion. 
The graph will look like a tree and we will traverse the graph from left to right.
